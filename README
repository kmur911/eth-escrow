    - set "buyer", "seller", and "arbitrator" to the addresses you want assigned as such in the newly created contract
    - uncomment the section titled "Create and Deploy Contract" and then run "make run"
    - Copy the printed address into the "contractAddress" variable, ctrl c to continue
    - For all subsequent calls comment out "Create and Deploy Contract" and uncomment "Connect to Contract"
    - Then you can uncomment whichever other sections you want in addition to "Connect to Contract", and use "make run" to execute
